# Meta Front-end Developer Capstone Project - Little Lemon Website

## Purpose

The following project was completed as part of the Meta Front-end Developer Course on Coursera as the final capstone project. The goal of the project was to build a React-based web application for a fictional client, the Little Lemon restaurant. By applying the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course, I was able to build a front-end website that solved the problem the client was facing while following the proper lifecycle of designing and developing a website.  

## Details

The technologies used to make this website are React v18.2 typed in JavaScript(JSX) and styled with vanilla CSS. The UI/UX was designed using Figma, from wireframing the project to creating initial prototypes, as well as creating personas and customer journeys to help solve the problem that the Little Lemon restaurant was facing. This was a great learning opportunity for me as it was my first time learning Figma and the process and principles of UI/UX design. Jest was used to conduct unit tests on the website throughout the project to ensure the website functioned as intended. 

The goal of the project was to build a new website for the Little Lemon restaurant, and implement a reservation page to allow customers to reserve a table online while being UI/UX friendly so customers had an easy time navigating the website. One of the main issues faced while building the project was the available times API. Originally the goal of the project was to connect to the API so that the reservation form could utilize live data to show available times based on the selected date. Since the API link was broken, I had to implement a fake API that returned a randomly generated array of available times.
